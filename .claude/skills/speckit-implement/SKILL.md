# Speckit Implement Skill

# Pre-ETS slice-scoped implementation

Apply these rules throughout the wrapped implementation workflow. They limit one run to one implementation
slice from `plan.md`, as described in `docs/engineering/git-workflow.md#implementation-slices`.

## Resolve the current slice

Before loading `tasks.md`, read the current branch with `git branch --show-current` and the implementation slices
in `plan.md`. Branch names follow `docs/engineering/git-workflow.md#branches`:

- `{number}-{slug}-impl` is the first slice listed in `plan.md`.
- `{number}-{slug}-impl-<slice>` is the slice whose ID is `<slice>`.

Stop and ask the user which slice to implement when the branch matches neither form, its number and slug do not
match the feature directory, the slice ID is not in `plan.md`, or `tasks.md` has no section for that slice. Do not
infer a slice from unchecked tasks.

## Slice scope

- Execute only the tasks in the current slice's section of `tasks.md`. Do not execute, mark, or edit tasks that
  belong to another slice.
- Earlier slices are complete on the base branch. If an earlier slice's task is unchecked, stop and report it
  rather than finishing it here.
- Wherever the wrapped workflow refers to all tasks, the task list, or completion, read it as the current slice's
  tasks. Unchecked tasks in later slices never block this slice's completion.
- Do not move work between slices. When a task cannot be completed inside the slice as planned, stop and report a
  plan correction through `docs/engineering/git-workflow.md#corrections`.
- Requirements, delivery plans, GitHub issues, `spec.md`, `verification.md`, `plan.md`, and `contracts/` remain
  read-only. Mark completed tasks in `tasks.md` only.

## File count before handoff

In the slice's commit-and-push task, count files after committing and before pushing. First confirm the worktree
is clean (`git status --porcelain` prints nothing), so no staged, unstaged, or untracked change escapes the count.
Then list the files the slice changes against its base branch with `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD`, where
`<base>` is the branch below this one in the stack. Count hand-written files, and list lockfile changes and
generated output separately. Compare the count with the slice's estimate in `plan.md` and the limit of about 15
hand-written files. When the count exceeds either without a reason that `plan.md` already states, stop before
pushing and report it as a plan correction. Otherwise record the count, and any reason `plan.md` gives, for the
pull request body.

## Verification handoff and stop

The slice ends with its verification-handoff tasks from `tasks.md`: run the repository checks, commit, and push the
slice as a draft pull request; request verification as described in `docs/engineering/verification-harness.md`;
then address the report, repeat verification as needed, and record the final report in `quickstart.md` and the
pull request. Wait for each report before continuing. Do not proceed while a requested report is outstanding.
The slice passes only when the report meets the gate in `docs/engineering/verification-harness.md#gate-and-escalation`.
A result that needs a limitation not already approved in `verification.md` or `plan.md` is a correction for the
owning phase; stop and report it rather than naming a new limitation in the pull request.

Record the final report in `quickstart.md` as an evidence-only commit. Before pushing it, confirm that
`git diff <verified-SHA>..HEAD` touches only the feature's `quickstart.md` execution results; such a commit needs no
new verification. Name the verified SHA in the pull request body. Any other change after the verified SHA, including
application code, instrumentation, tests, run instructions, or `quickstart.md` steps, needs a new verification
request.

After the final report is recorded, stop. Do not create the next slice's branch, start its tasks, or mark the
pull request ready unless the user asks.


## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before implementation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_implement` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Treat checklist markers as a read-only gate: scan checkbox state, report status, and ask before proceeding when needed; do NOT modify checklist files or markers
   - `checklists/requirements.md` is the built-in spec-quality checklist maintained by `/speckit-specify` and `/speckit-clarify`; custom checklists generated by `/speckit-checklist` are reviewer-owned requirements-quality review artifacts
   - For custom checklists, `[x]` means the reviewer determined the requirements-quality criterion is satisfied; it does NOT mean implementation work is complete
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Checked items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Unchecked items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Checked | Unchecked | Status |
     |-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12      | 0         | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5       | 3         | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6       | 0         | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 unchecked items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have unchecked items

   - **If any checklist has unchecked items**:
     - Display the table with unchecked item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists have unchecked items. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are checked**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read .specify/memory/constitution.md for governance constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`
   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`
   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`
   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `autom4te.cache/`, `config.status`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`
   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`
   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`

   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit-tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

## Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks

**You MUST complete this section before reporting completion to the user.**

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it does not exist, or no hooks are registered under `hooks.after_implement`, skip to the Completion Report.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_implement` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue to the Completion Report.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`) — **You MUST emit `EXECUTE_COMMAND:` for each mandatory hook**:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

## Completion Report

Report final status with summary of completed work.

## Done When

- [ ] All tasks in tasks.md completed and marked `[X]`
- [ ] Implementation validated against specification, plan, and test coverage
- [ ] Extension hooks dispatched or skipped according to the rules in Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks above
- [ ] Completion reported to user with summary of completed work


## Pre-ETS completion rule

Completion means the current slice, not the feature. Report the slice ID and branch, the slice tasks completed,
the hand-written file count against the plan's estimate, the pushed SHA, the final verification result for each of
the slice's claim IDs with the approved limitation in `verification.md` or `plan.md` that covers any result other
than `established`, and the next slice in `plan.md` without starting it.
